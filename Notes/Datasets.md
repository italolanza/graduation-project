The Machinery Fault Database is composed of 1951 multivariate time-series acquired by sensors on a SpectraQuest's Machinery Fault Simulator (MFS) Alignment-Balance-Vibration (ABVT). The 1951 comprises six different simulated states: normal function, imbalance fault, horizontal and vertical misalignment faults and, inner and outer bearing faults.
