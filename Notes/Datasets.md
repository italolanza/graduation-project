# Datasets

## MNIST
The MNIST database (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database) is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems. The database is also widely used for training and testing in the field of machine learning.

It has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples. It is a subset of a larger set available from NIST.

The Machinery Fault Database is composed of 1951 multivariate time-series acquired by sensors on a SpectraQuest's Machinery Fault Simulator (MFS) Alignment-Balance-Vibration (ABVT). The 1951 comprises six different simulated states: normal function, imbalance fault, horizontal and vertical misalignment faults and, inner and outer bearing faults. 

The database is composed by several CSV (Comma-Separated Values) files, each one with 8 columns, one column for each sensor, according to:

+ column 1: tachometer signal that allows to estimate rotation frequency;
+ columns 2 to 4: underhang bearing accelerometer (axial, radiale tangential direction);
+ columns 5 to 7: overhang bearing accelerometer (axial, radiale tangential direction);
+ column 8: microphone.
